# TODO

## Create installer script

* text file containing list of files to install including source and destination paths
* Installer shell script
  * Should be useable for installing from other repositories (e.g. with Python scripts) too
  * Should use just `curl` (not `git`)
  * Should provide installation profiles (like NTT-Gaia)
